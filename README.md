# geometry dash
created with graphics library

there are two programs:
one is the game geometry dash based on the famous game
second is a world editor when you can design your own map that you will play on in the game

as same as in the original game when you edit your map with the world editor you can build a block just by clicking on the mouse
where you want to build the block and evey additional click change the type of the block where it can be:
regular block - you walk on it in the game but if bump into it you die
spike - if you touch it you die
double jump - if you double jump right when you touch it it like a regular block
imaginary block - it look like a regular block in the game but you can go through it
start point - you can create the point that the game will start from there
finish line - you can create the line where the game will finish

every click on a block change it to the next type of block until it back to no block
